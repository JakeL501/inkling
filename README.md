Inkling

With Inkling our goal is to connect a potential client with a tattoo artist. The problems we want to solve are as follows:

 - limit the amount of poorly chosen tattoo's, 
 - allow clients to think more about what tattoo they want as well as get feedback from artists,
 - avoid walk-in appointments with people who don't know what they wanted to do. 

Getting Started:

First clone the repository locally using "git clone" in the git bash terminal and adding the link https://github.com/JakeL501/inkling.git.

After this cd into inkling then inkling_react and do an npm install. When done cd into client and do the same. After all the npm installs are complete cd out of client back to inkling_react and run yarn start. 

React should automatically open your localhost on your web browser.
