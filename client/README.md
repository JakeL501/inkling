# inkling
What is inkling? Inkling is an app that connects a tattoo artist with a potential clients. This will hopefully be a useful tool to downsize the amount of "bad" tattoos. Passport will be used for authentication which will have two forms. One will be for artists and the other for clients. 

The difference? 

Clients will have a private profile where they see two options. One is create a tattoo ticket with an image upload of what they want. This will be posted publicly when submitted for artists to see. The next thing is to have a way to find inspirational tattoos to try and help people find a type/style of tattoo to get for themselves.

Artists will also have a private profile where they can view saved tattoo tickets and delete them. They also will have a public profile where clients can see a link to their portfolio as well as some images of tattoos they have done as an example. 

Everything will be saved with mongoDB and we will have it live via Heroku.
